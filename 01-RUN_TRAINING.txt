To run training protocols: 
- enter individual ML folders;
- run both ipython notebooks (to train on dGoffset and dG)

Depending on hardware, with the current settings RF and DNN will take 20-50 hours to finish running. If faster runtimes are desired then the n_calls variable can be reduced, but note this may result in worse convergence.
Note that when these notebooks are running, the authors' model files will be overwritten on your local environment. 
After all training notebooks have finished running, all the publication's figures can be reproduced by running the notebooks 02, 03 and 04.
