# Hybrid FEP/ML

Repository for reproducing results published in [insert link].

To reproduce results from scratch, please go through files 00-04 sequentially. All figures can be reproduced using 02-04 during which the existing pickled model files will be used. Running 00 and 01 overwrites model files. 
Prior to running any notebooks, create a conda environment using the .yml provided in ./conda/
