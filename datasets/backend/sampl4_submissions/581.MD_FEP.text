\f0\fs24 \cf0 The absolute hydration free energies for the set of 24 Blind compounds were calculated using MD/FEP with a developmental version of OPLS force field and Desmond MD package.  The molecules were solvated in an orthorhombic water box using a 10 \'c5 buffer with no ions. The solvated structures were then minimized for 10 steps with the steepest descent method followed by a maximum of 1990 steps with the LBFGS method. The minimized system was further relaxed with a 24 ps molecular dynamics simulation at 300K temperature and 1 atm pressure. A twelve lambda window schedule was used and each lambda was run for 10 ns. Production run was carried out for 10ns for each lambda window using a developmental version of MD/FEP in Desmond. We used the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) method to estimate the free energy difference from the simulations.}
